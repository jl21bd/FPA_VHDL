# FPA_VHDL
Implementation of Flower Pollination Algorithm in VHDL

The flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm inspired by the pollination process of flowering plants.

The algorithm starts with the initialization of the flower population.
Then, it updates the flower positions based on the Levy flights and local and global pollination.

The target function to optimize in the example is the `six_hump_camel_back` function.
